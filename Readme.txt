This program displays the "Towers of Hanoi" problem, and uses a recursive
implementation to solve the problem. The user has the ability to enter how many disks they would like to use in the program. The program writes to a file, so an output file must be provided.
		   
The "Towers of Hanoi" problem starts with a user-defined number of disks on a pole. Each disk is smaller than the disk below it. The program moves this stack from Pole A to Pole C. Only one disk can be moved at a time, and a larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk. There is an auxiliary pole that can be used as a "place holder".

This program was written for the Advanced C Programming course with UCSC Extension.
